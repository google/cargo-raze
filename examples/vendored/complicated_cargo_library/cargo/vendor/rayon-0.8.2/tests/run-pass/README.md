This directory contains test files that are **expected to run and
execute successfully**. Often, though, such tests are better written
just using the standard `#[test]` mechanism. In any case, to create
such a test, just make a `.rs` file.

Note: if the test uses unstable features, prefer the
`run-pass-unstable` directory.

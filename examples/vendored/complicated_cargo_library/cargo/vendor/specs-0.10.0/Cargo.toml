description = "Specs is an Entity-Component System library written in Rust.\nUnlike most other ECS libraries out there, it provides\n\n* easy parallelism\n* high flexibility\n    * contains 5 different storages for components, which can be extended by the user\n    * it's types are mostly not coupled, so you can easily write some part yourself and\n      still use Specs\n    * `System`s may read from and write to components and resources, can depend on each\n      other and you can use barriers to force several stages in system execution\n* high performance for real-world applications\n"

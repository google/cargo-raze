description = "Odds and ends â€” collection miscellania. Extra functionality for slices (`.find()`, `RevSlice`), strings and other things. Debug checked variants of `get_unchecked` and `slice_unchecked`, and extra methods for strings and vectors: `repeat`, `insert_str` and `splice`. Things in odds may move to more appropriate crates if we find them."

# Cargo Raze Examples

The examples directory contains some example usages of Cargo Raze to set up projects for Bazel building.

# Contributing

This directory is used in the testing process of Cargo Raze to make sure that practical examples work
during the test process for all contributions. Please do not commit new code here, as it will be destroyed
by the testing process. Instead, new examples should be added to the `smoke_test` directory.
